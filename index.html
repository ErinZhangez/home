		<h1> Introduction to shibes :3 </h1>
		<p> The Shiba Inu dog breed was originally bred to flush birds and small game, and was occasionally used to hunt wild boar. He is one of Japan’s six native breeds: Akita (large), Kishu, Hokkaido, Kai, Shikoku (medium), and Shiba (small). He is known for his spirited personality, small upright ears, and cat-like agility. Today he serves primarily as a companion dog in Japan and the United States.</p>
		<h1>Puppies</h1>
		<p> It’s a face you’ve seen a million times on your Facebook feed: the doge face. “Such Wow.” “Many cool.” “Much awesome.” The Internet jargon is slapped onto a photo of a fox-like dog in multicolored Comic Sans font. That fox-like dog is the intelligent (and now hilarious) Shiba Inu. </p>

		<h1> Relatives </h1>
		<h2> Akitas </h2>
		<p> The Akita is a large and powerful dog breed with a noble and intimidating presence. They were originally used for guarding royalty and nobility in feudal Japan. These dogs also tracked and hunted wild boar, black bear, and sometimes deer. The Akita does not back down from challenges and does not frighten easily. Consequently, they are fearless and loyal guardians of their families. Yet they are also affectionate, respectful, and amusing dogs when properly trained and socialized.
		An Akita is bound to shed quite a bit, and you may be wiping some drool from their face if you bring one home. Certainly, owners should be prepared for some cleanup. Furthermore, they tend to be stubborn and are not overly fond of strangers. While those can be good traits for a watchdog, they will need an experienced trainer if they are to interact with other animals or people. Novices beware. That said, dogs of this breed are faithful companions that will be attached to the right owner for life and shower them with adoration and love. Therefore, if you and your family are up for the challenge and consider adopting an Akita, you’ll have a lifelong friend that won’t let you down. </p>
